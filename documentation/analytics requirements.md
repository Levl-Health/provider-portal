#### Symptoms
Displayed as one or two images in the table of patients. The patient will have one image if there is only a value for one item. There will be two images if there is a value for two or three symptoms. If all three symptoms have values, then the top two are displayed.

The values are computed by taking an average of each symptom from the last 30 days of the DailyMetrics table.

Query (psuedo code)
SELECT AVG(adhd) AS adhd, AVG(anxiety) AS anxiety, AVG(depression) AS depression
FROM DailyMetrics
WHERE providerId = [the doctor's id]
  AND active = true
  AND (BETWEEN today - 30 AND today)
